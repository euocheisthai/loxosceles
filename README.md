# loxosceles

tg bot for automatically uploading images a channel (or channels) of your choice posts to a cloud storage.

Current status could be described as "everything but the business logic is ready".

`/help` - check if it's alive at all;
`/stalk` - subscribe to channel image updates (does fuckall atm);
`/storage` - set default cloud storage to upload pics to (ditto);

## local deployment

k8s manifests are [over there](https://github.com/euocheisthai/lab/tree/master/cluster/loxosceles), bar the secret.
